# BlockWar
A UE5 Game: Build Forts, Battle for Victory

## About
BlockWar is an innovative multiplayer FPS that combines tactical base construction with team-based combat. Build elaborate fortifications during the build phase, then battle it out in intense combat to capture the enemy flag.

Built in Unreal Engine 5, inspired by classic community mods.

## Technical Approach

**Procedural Generation + Unit Testing**: BlockWar uses UE5's native procedural generation tools (PCG Framework, Blueprints, C++, Python, Geometry Script) to create game content. This approach enables comprehensive unit testing while maintaining tight engine integration.

**Key Technologies:**
- **UE5 PCG Framework**: Level and content generation
- **Geometry Script**: Procedural mesh generation
- **Python**: Editor automation and unit testing
- **C++**: Performance-critical systems and testing
- **Blueprints**: Gameplay logic and procedural workflows
